# Æther Framework
## What is the Æther framework

> *n. Greek Mythology*
> The poetic personification of the clear upper air breathed by the Olympians.

A very thin and lightweight PHP framework, based on the principles of dependency injection.

### How do I use it?
View our [example application].
You will see that we include this base repository which defines all the interfaces we need to create an application.

For more concrete implementations of the interfaces there are several packages available
1. [Http Stream] - Implements the HTTP interface using PHP stream wrappers
1. [Config JSON] - Defines JSON based configuration
1. [Config Environment] - Defines Environment based configuration

[example application]: https://github.com/DelphicOkami/aether-hello-world
[Http Stream]: https://github.com/DelphicOkami/aether-http-stream
[Config JSON]: https://github.com/DelphicOkami/aether-config-json
[Config Environment]: https://github.com/DelphicOkami/aether-config-environment# AEtherFramework Framework base
